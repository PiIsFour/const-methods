Why is mutating a object in its methods able to cause problems

just run the code with:
```npm start```

You will see a little story play out about a traveller findig some treasure and later try to remember where it was.

In the first story the treveller will have a problem to find the treasure again because while moving he also changed the treasure possition.

In the second story we never get the problem because we never change an object

In the third story we see that if we are carefull and remember to clone the possition we can also work with mutating data structures

The Lesson you draw from this might depend on tast.
